This is an Alcolizer script, I tried to replicate the one's australian police use as best as possible.

# Features
- Realistic and interactive user interface
- Optimized, 0.00ms while idle and 0.02 while using
- Extremely configurable and easy to use
- Standalone, requires no other resources

# Installation
Drag and drop the resource into your script folder
Fill out your configuration file
Enjoy :)

# Support

# Thanks

Cheers! üçª
